* describe your role in the research, including by clarifying your contribution to collaborative research and to the actual writing of joint publications;
* discuss the reasons for selecting the medium (e.g., journal article, conference presentation, etc.) for mobilizing the research, if appropriate;
* indicate any collaboration with other researchers and/or with other knowledge users from outside academia;
* discuss the significance, relevance and impact of your work in relation to the social sciences and humanities, the natural sciences and engineering or to health-related fields and processes, if appropriate;

Be as specific as possible. Provide background information to position your proposed research within the context of the current knowledge in the field. State the objectives, hypothesis, research question and your specific role. Outline the experimental or theoretical approach to be taken (citing literature pertinent to the proposal), the methods and procedures to be used and the contribution of the project to the advancement of knowledge. 

Your communication skills are reflected by the clarity of the proposal and speak to the research potential and leadership (potential and demonstrated ability) selection criteria.

When writing your research proposal, employ the citation style common to your field of research. Do not use more than one citation style. Footnotes should be employed for citation purposes only, and should not elaborate on the information contained in the 2 page research proposal.

* International research community
* Society at large

In evaluating this criterion, both the prestige of the Vanier CGS and the stage and nature of the candidate's academic career should be considered. In the case of health professionals, consideration should be given to standards of research productivity, etc. for their level of experience/qualifications relative to a PhD student. For applicants who have relevant work experience, scientific productivity prior to graduate school should be considered.

Supporting evidence to be evaluated for this criterion:

* Academic record (institution transcripts)
* Scholarships/awards (CV)
